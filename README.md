# PPM File reader

A simple PPM file reader, created from scratch using mainly examples of such files.
I am not sure why I've created this, we've had to memorise this image format for our university course, so I've craated a program and decode and render them.

## Features

 - Read image formats P1,P2,P3,P4,P5,P6.
 - Zoom feature up to 100x, for very small images.
 - Client side only, does not upload images to any server and the web page is hosted on github pages.
